## :gear: Build

The app uses Unsplash API, hence you need to get your own API key from [here](https://unsplash.com/documentation).
In order to sign your builds generate `splashy.jks` keystore and add keystore password, alias and store password in `secrets.properties`.

secrets.properties would look like this:
```
unsplash.access.key=#Add your unsplash key
splashy.keystore.password=#Add your keystore password
splashy.key.alias=#Add your key alias
splashy.key.password=#Add your key password
```
